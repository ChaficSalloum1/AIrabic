We need to properly map out and set up our **lesson architecture** according to our **Lebanese Arabic learning platform PRD** and overwrite the placeholder content with our **actual structured lessons and exercises.**

### **📌 Objective:**
1️⃣ **Replace all placeholder lessons & exercises** (e.g., “Greetings” and “Food & Dining”) with our structured Lebanese Arabic lessons.
2️⃣ **Ensure lesson architecture matches our PRD** for modular, scalable growth.
3️⃣ **Dynamically load lesson content in `pages/lessons/[id].tsx`** from a central data file.
4️⃣ **Validate that exercises load correctly within each lesson** and follow a logical learning progression.

### **📂 Folder & Architecture Overview:**
✅ `data/lessons.ts` → Stores **all lesson and exercise data** (to be fully replaced with our lessons).  
✅ `lib/types.ts` → Ensures type safety for lessons and exercises.  
✅ `pages/lessons/[id].tsx` → Dynamically loads **lesson data based on ID**.  
✅ `components/exercises/` → Stores **modular exercise components**.  
✅ `lib/localStorage.ts` → Tracks user progress across lessons.

### **🚀 Tasks for Replit AI:**
1️⃣ **Delete all placeholder lessons and replace them with our structured lessons** in `data/lessons.ts`.  
2️⃣ **Ensure `pages/lessons/[id].tsx` dynamically loads our lessons.**  
3️⃣ **Validate that `components/exercises/` properly renders each exercise within a lesson.**  
4️⃣ **Ensure lesson progression logic works** (completing a lesson unlocks the next).  
5️⃣ **Check UI matches our structure** (lesson navigation & layout improvements).  

---

### **📌 Deliverables:**
✅ **Cleaned & updated `data/lessons.ts` with our structured lessons.**  
✅ **Updated `pages/lessons/[id].tsx` to correctly load lesson content dynamically.**  
✅ **Verified exercise rendering logic** (all exercises should load properly).  
✅ **Improved UI flow** to match our PRD & best practices.
